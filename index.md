# Introduction

**Unbody** is an open-source, modular backend stack for building AI-native software that understands, reasons, and acts on knowledge â€” instead of just data(bases).

Designed to bring us closer to a more human kind of software, Unbody is built around four core layers: **Perception**, **Memory**, **Reasoning**, and **Action**. [Read more](/architecture)

No duct tape AI tooling. No pipelines made of glue. Just one composable system.  
_Think of it as the Supabase of the AI era._
