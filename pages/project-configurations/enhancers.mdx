# Enhancers

Enhancers transform raw data into enriched, actionable knowledge. They are essential for turning unstructured or semi-structured data into a usable format for AI-native applications.

Enhancers are **data-type specific**, meaning they cater to specific data formats like text, images, or videos. They are also **modular** and designed to integrate seamlessly with your data pipeline.

Unbody supports two types of enhancers:

1. **Built-in Enhancers**: Out-of-the-box solutions for common enrichment tasks.
2. **Custom Enhancers**: Flexible pipelines tailored to your unique workflows.

---

## Built-in Enhancers

Built-in enhancers are categorized by data type, offering seamless functionality right out of the box.

### Available Built-in Enhancers

| Data Type | Enhancer Name | Functionality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Text** | AutoSummary | Summarizes text into concise outputs. |
| **Text** | AutoKeywords | Extracts key terms from textual data. |
| **Image** | AutoVision | Captions images, performs OCR, and tags objects within images. |
| **Video** | AutoChapters | Generates video chapters based on subtitles or transcriptions. |
| **Audio** | AutoTranscribe | Transcribes speech from audio files into text. |

### Using Built-in Enhancers

To enable enhancers:

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard** and enable them under the **Enhancers** section.
2. Alternatively, configure them using the **Admin API**.

```jsx
import { UnbodyAdmin, ProjectSettings, AutoSummary, AutoKeywords } from 'unbody/admin'

// Initialize the Admin API
const admin = new UnbodyAdmin({
  auth: {
    username: '[admin-key-id]',
    password: '[admin-key-secret]',
  },
})

const projectSettings = new ProjectSettings();

// Enable AutoSummary and AutoKeywords
projectSettings.set(new AutoSummary(AutoSummary.OpenAI.GPT4o))
projectSettings.set(new AutoKeywords(AutoKeywords.OpenAI.GPT4o))

const project = await admin.projects.ref({
  name: "My First Project",
  settings: projectSettings,
})

// Apply settings to the project
await project.save()

console.log(`Applied enhancers for project: ${project.name}`)
```

## Custom Enhancers

Custom enhancers offer unparalleled flexibility, allowing you to design complex enrichment workflows tailored to your application's needs.

### Why Use Custom Enhancers?

- **Specificity**: When prebuilt options donâ€™t meet your requirements.
- **Complexity**: For chaining multiple tasks into a single, cohesive workflow.
- **Adaptability**: To work with unique or non-standard data types and formats.

---

### Architecture of Custom Enhancers

Custom enhancers follow a structured architecture:

- **Pipeline**: The overarching container that defines the workflow.
- **Steps**: Discrete tasks within the pipeline.
- **Actions**: Core operations performed in each step (e.g., text generation, tagging).

---

### Workflow for Custom Enhancers

Creating a custom enhancer involves three main steps:

1. **Define a Pipeline**
2. **Add Steps to the Pipeline**
3. **Attach the Pipeline to Project Settings**

---

## 1. Pipelines

### What is a Pipeline?

A pipeline is a container for the entire enhancement workflow. It:

- Targets a specific collection (e.g., `TextDocument`, `VideoFile`).
- Contains one or more steps executed in sequence.
- Supports conditional logic to enable or skip steps dynamically.

### Defining a Pipeline

```tsx
import { Enhancement } from 'unbody/admin'

const pipeline = new Enhancement.Pipeline(
  'custom_pipeline', // Unique name
  'TextDocument',    // Target collection
)
```

---

## 2. Steps

### What is a Step?

A step represents a single task in the pipeline. Each step:

- Has a **name** for identification.
- Performs an **action**.
- Specifies **output mappings** for storing results.
- Can include **conditional execution logic** and failure handling.

---

### Anatomy of a Step

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | `string` | Yes | Unique identifier for the step. |
| **action** | `Action` | Yes | The action to perform. |
| **output** | `Object` | No | Maps results to database fields. |
| **if** | `Function(ctx):bool` | No | Conditional logic for execution. |
| **onFailure** | `"continue" | "stop"` | No |

---

### Example: Defining a Step

```tsx
const step = new Enhancement.Step(
  'summarize_step',
  new Enhancement.Action.TextGenerator({
    model: 'openai-gpt-4',
    prompt: (ctx) => `Summarize the following: ${ctx.record.content}`,
  }),
  {
    output: {
      summary: (ctx) => ctx.result.content,
    },
    if: (ctx) => ctx.record.content.length > 100, // Execute only if content > 100 chars
    onFailure: 'continue', // Continue even if this step fails
  },
)

pipeline.add(step)

```

---

## 3. Actions

### What is an Action?

Actions are the core operations within a step. Unbody supports various built-in actions, each tailored for specific tasks. All actions share:

- **Initialization Parameters**: Define what the action does.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Use `ctx` to adjust actions based on runtime context.

---

### How Actions Work

Actions are initialized and attached to steps. Each action:

1. Takes input parameters (e.g., prompt, model).
2. Executes and produces results.
3. Outputs the results to the pipeline or database.

---

### Available Actions

### **1. TextGenerator**

Generates text using a language model.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **model** | `string` | Model to use (e.g., `openai-gpt-4`). |
| **prompt** | `Function(ctx):string` | Dynamic prompt for the model. |
| **temperature** | `number` | Creativity level (higher = more creative). |

**Example**:

```tsx
new Enhancement.Action.TextGenerator({
  model: 'openai-gpt-4',
  prompt: (ctx) => `Summarize this: ${ctx.record.content}`,
  temperature: 0.7,
})

```

---

### **2. StructuredGenerator**

Generates structured JSON output based on a schema.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **model** | `string` | Model to use (e.g., `openai-gpt-4`). |
| **prompt** | `Function(ctx):string` | Dynamic prompt for the model. |
| **schema** | `Function(ctx):Schema` | Schema for structured output (uses Zod). |

**Example**:

```tsx
new Enhancement.Action.StructuredGenerator({
  model: 'openai-gpt-4',
  prompt: (ctx) => `Extract tags: ${ctx.record.content}`,
  schema: (ctx, { z }) => z.object({
    tags: z.array(z.string()).describe('Tags for the content'),
  }),
})

```

---

### Best Practices for Custom Enhancers

1. **Reusability**:
    - Use `ctx.vars` to avoid redundant prompts or configurations.
2. **Error Handling**:
    - Use `onFailure: "continue"` for non-critical steps.
3. **Testing**:
    - Test pipelines on a small dataset before deployment.
