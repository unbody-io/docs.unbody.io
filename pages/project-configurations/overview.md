# Project Configuration Overview

## Important: Configuration Immutability  

Once the project is created, most configuration settings are **immutable** and cannot be changed.  

### Exception: Generator Module Models  
The only configurable setting after project creation is the **Generator Module Models**. This allows for adjustments to the models used by the generator module without affecting the rest of the configuration.  

Please review and confirm all other configuration details during setup, as they cannot be modified after initialization.
