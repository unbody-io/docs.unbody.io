# Discord
This guide offers strategic insights into connecting Discord to Unbody.

### **Entrypoint** — Selecting a Channel

The entry point for Discord integration is a channel, hence one source contains the messages from a single channel. The channel can be a text channel, voice channel, or inside a category.

**Class objects**
- `DiscordMessage`

**Supported Files & Data Types**
- Text messages
- Images
- Videos
- Audio

                            outputTokens
                            totalTokens
                            }
                        }
                        }
                    }
                    content
                    }
                }
            }
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### **Troubleshooting**
- In order to be able to connect your Discord to Unbody, you need to have the admin role in the server.
- If you are unable to connect your Discord to Unbody, please check if the bot has the necessary permissions to access the channel.
- For private channels, you need to make sure that the bot has access to the channel. You can do this by adding Unbody's bot to the channel.

### **Limitations**
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Currently we can only fetch the last 1000 messages from a channel. We are working on increasing this limit.
