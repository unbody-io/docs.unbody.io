# Hello, [New] World!
Users don’t want data. They want answers.

Apps need to speak, think, and solve.

Old tools can’t build this.

We need new tools. Tools for AI-native products.

That’s why we built **Unbody**.

## AI-Native vs. AI-Enabled

**AI-native**: AI is the core. Remove it, nothing works.

**AI-enabled**: AI is bolted on. Remove it, and the app still exists.

AI-enabled is the past. AI-native is the future.

We’re here to build the future.

## Duct-Taped Stacks

Two stacks. Two headaches.

1. **AI stack**: LangChain, LLamaindex, [Unstrcutred.io](http://Unstrcutred.io), Vercel SDK, vector DBs, pipelines.
2. **Product stack**: React, Express, MERN.

They don’t talk. You duct-tape them together.

It’s slow. It’s messy. It’s painful.

Old tools weren’t built for AI-native apps. They’re solving yesterday’s problems.

## One Stack to Rule Them All

**One stack.** No mess. No hacks.

- Ingest, process, vectorize—all in one place.
- Deliver AI-powered data via a single GraphQL API.
- AI and product development? Together at last.

## How Unbody is Different

We build **AI products**, not features.

**Others**:

- LangChain, LlamaIndex: Built for AI engineers. Fragmented.
- Vercel AI SDKs: Basic proxies. No full stack.
- OpenAI, Cohere: Just the model, nothing more.

**Unbody**:

- Unified. Seamless. Model-agnostic.
- One stack, one workflow.

Stop bolting AI onto old tools. Build AI-native.
