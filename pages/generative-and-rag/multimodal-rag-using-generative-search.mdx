# Multimodal Rag Using Generative Search
{/* TODO: needs improvement here */}
Create comprehensive insights by processing multiple types of data simultaneously - image, text, video and audio. Multimodal RAG combines these different modalities to generate richer, more contextual understanding of your content.

## Image Analysis with Metadata
Need to analyze multiple images while considering their metadata, OCR text, and captions? Use [`.generate.fromMany()`](/content-api/generative#example-2---from-many) with [Messages](/content-api/generative#using-messages-instead-of-prompts) and [Vars](/content-api/generative#using-vars) to combine visual analysis with metadata examination for comprehensive image insights.
