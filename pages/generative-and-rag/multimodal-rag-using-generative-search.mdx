# Multimodal Rag Using Generative Search

Create comprehensive insights by processing multiple types of data simultaneously - visual content (images), text (OCR, captions), and metadata. Multimodal RAG combines these different modalities to generate richer, more contextual understanding of your content.

## Image Analysis with Metadata
Need to analyze multiple images while considering their metadata, OCR text, and captions? Use [`.generate.fromMany()`](/content-api/generative#example-2---from-many) with [Messages](/content-api/generative#using-messages-instead-of-prompts) and [Vars](/content-api/generative#using-vars) to combine visual analysis with metadata examination for comprehensive image insights.

The setting appears to be a barn-like structure with a brick floor.\n- **Generated Caption**: \"Classic car parked in a barn with hay bales.\" This caption is accurate as it successfully identifies the key elements in the image â€“ the classic car and the barn setting with hay bales.\n- **OCR Text**: The OCR text for this image is empty (\"\"). This is appropriate since there is no visible text in the image to recognize or transcribe.\n- **Alt Description**: \"6\". The alt description provided is not descriptive of the image content and does not aid in understanding or accessibility.\n\n#### Image 2 Analysis\n- **Visual Content**: The second image shows a classic, green Jaguar E-Type convertible parked on a paved area, surrounded by a lush green grassy field with trees in the background. The car is facing towards the viewer.\n- **Generated Caption**: \"A classic green convertible car parked on a paved area with a grassy background.\" This caption is very accurate and descriptive, highlighting the main features of the image such as the color and type of the car, as well as the setting.\n- **OCR Text**: Similar to the first image, the OCR text for this image is empty (\"\"). This is correct since there is no readable text in the image.\n- **Alt Description**: \"1\". Again, this alt description does not provide any useful information about the image and lacks descriptive value.\n\n### Summary:\n1. **Caption Accuracy**: Both auto-generated captions accurately describe the scenes in the respective images. They successfully capture the type and color of the cars, as well as their settings.\n2. **OCR Text Relation**: In both cases, the OCR text is empty, which is appropriate as there are no textual elements in either of the images.\n3. **Alt Description Comparison**: The alt descriptions (\"6\" and \"1\") are not informative and do not convey any visual content of the images. Alt descriptions could be improved by providing brief, relevant descriptions of the images to enhance accessibility.\n\nOverall, the captions and OCR text are handled appropriately, but the alt descriptions need significant improvement to be useful.",
