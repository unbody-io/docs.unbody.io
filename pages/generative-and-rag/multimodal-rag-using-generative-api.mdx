# Multimodal RAG Using Generative API

Generate insights by analyzing text and images together. Multimodal capabilities allow combining different types of data - like diagrams with text descriptions or images with metadata - to create comprehensive understanding.

## Using Multimodal RAG to Analyze Product Images
When you want to analyze product images and generate detailed product descriptions, use [`.generate.text()`](/generative-api/text-gen) with [Message-Based Input](/generative-api/text-gen#example-3---message-based-input). This is perfect for e-commerce applications where you need to generate rich product descriptions from images.

```typescript copy
const {
  data: { payload }
} = await unbody.generate
                .text([
                  {
                    role: "system",
                    content: "You are an expert at analyzing product images and creating detailed, SEO-friendly product descriptions. Focus on key features, benefits, and use cases."
                  },
                  {
                    type: "image",
                    content: {
                      url: "https://example.com/product-image.jpg"
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    role: "user",
                    content: "Analyze this product image and create a detailed product description that highlights its key features, benefits, and ideal use cases. Include technical specifications and target audience."
                  }
                ], {
                  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
                  temperature: 0.7,
                  maxTokens: 1000
                });

## Using Multimodal RAG to Analyze Technical Documentation
When you need to analyze technical documentation that includes diagrams, code snippets, and text, use a combination of search queries and [`.generate.text()`](/generative-api/text-gen) to create comprehensive technical summaries.

```typescript copy
const queries = [
  unbody.get.textDocument.search
                         .find("system architecture")
                         .select("title", "text", "autoSummary"),

  unbody.get.imageBlock.search
                       .find("system architecture diagram")
                       .select("url", "autoCaption"),

  unbody.get.codeBlock.search
                      .find("system architecture implementation")
                      .select("code", "language", "description")
];

// Execute all queries in parallel
const { data } = await unbody.exec(...queries);

const [docs, diagrams, codeSnippets] = data;

// Generate a technical summary using all the reference material
const {
  data: { payload: technicalSummary }
} = await unbody.generate
                .text([
                  {
                    role: "system",
                    content: "You are a technical documentation expert. Create clear, concise summaries of technical architectures and implementations."
                  },
                  {
                    role: "user",
                    content: `Analyze this technical documentation and create a comprehensive summary:

## Using Multimodal RAG to Generate Tarantino-Style Dialogue
Want to create content that draws from multiple types of reference material? Use a combination of search queries and [`.generate.text()`](/generative-api/text-gen) to collect and analyze diverse data sources like scripts, videos, subtitles, and images. Perfect for creative writing that requires deep understanding of specific styles or themes.

```typescript copy
const queries = [
  unbody.get.textDocument.search
                         .find("Quentin Tarantino")
                         .select("title", "text", "autoSummary"),

  unbody.get.videoFile.search
                      .find("Quentin Tarantino")
                      .select("originalName", "autoSummary"),

  unbody.get.subtitleFile.search
                        .find("Quentin Tarantino")

                  `Study these examples from Tarantino's films and create a new scene in his style:

                  ${JSON.stringify(images)}

                  Using these references, write a short 2-character scene (2-3 pages) that captures Tarantino's signature elements:
                  1. A seemingly mundane conversation that builds tension
                  2. Pop culture references
                  3. Sharp dialogue switches between casual and intense
                  4. Detailed scene description in his style
                  5. A surprise twist ending`,

    "content": "**INT. DUSKY, LOW-LIT DINER - NIGHT**\n\nThe camera pans across a diner filled with the aroma of coffee and the low murmur of a late-night crowd. A jukebox in the corner belts out a classic 70s rock tune.\n\nAt a booth, VINCE, a rugged, sharp-dressed man in his 40s, sits across from ELLA, a seemingly innocent-looking woman with a retro style, her eyes hiding more than they reveal. They both sip coffee, a chess board between them.\n\n**VINCE**  \n(*chuckling*)  \nYou really think Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\" beats Floyd's \"Echoes\"? C'mon, Ella, it's like comparing a fine scotch to a damn good bourbon.\n\n**ELLA**  \n(*smirking, moving her bishop*)  \nIt's all about the journey, Vince. Page and Plant take you on an expedition. \"Echoes\" just... floats you in space.\n\nVince reaches over, moving his knight. The clink of the chess pieces punctuates their words.\n\n**VINCE**  \nSpace? That's exactly it. It's ethereal. You need to elevate your taste.\n\nElla gives a small, mysterious smile and pushes her pawn forward.\n\n**ELLA**  \nSpeaking of tastes, how'd you find yourself in this mess? We're not exactly playing chess for fun, are we, Vince?\n\nThe clink grows sharper, the tension subtly building.\n\n**VINCE**  \n(*leaning in*)  \nWe all got debts, darling. You, out of all people, should know. Heard you've been running with the Valentino crew since Joey took a dive.\n\n**ELLA**  \n(*leaning back, unfazed*)  \nJoey had a loose tongue. And running's a stretch. I prefer... gliding through the chaos.\n\nShe captures Vince's knight, her fingers delicately precise. Vince's eyes narrow slightly, but he chuckles.\n\n**VINCE**  \nGlide, run, or dance, we all end up in the same hole, Ella. What's your end game here?\n\n**ELLA**  \nTo not end up like Joey.\n\nThere's a beat of silence as they both take a sip of coffee, the music from the jukebox switching to something moodier.\n\n**VINCE**  \nYou ever think about that last scene in *Thelma & Louise*? Sometimes going off the cliff is the only way to keep flying.\n\n**ELLA**  \n(*softly*)  \nOr you ensure you're not the one driving.\n\nAbruptly, Ella stands, her movement fluid. Vince watches, puzzled. She slides out a small envelope and tosses it on the table.\n\n**ELLA**  \nCheckmate.\n\nVince opens the envelope, finding a lone chess piece — a queen.\n\n**VINCE**  \nWhat's this?\n\n**ELLA**  \nYour ticket out—or your plunge off the cliff. You disappear tonight. New identity, new life.\n\nVince looks up, but Ella is already heading towards the door, her figure a shadow against the diner's retro lights.\n\n**VINCE**  \nAnd what about you, Ella?\n\nShe stops at the door, half-turning, a cryptic smile playing on her lips.\n\n**ELLA**  \nI'm not the one driving, remember?\n\nShe exits. Vince sits there, the queen piece in hand, a mix of confusion and realization dawning on him as the screen fades to black.\n\n**CUT TO BLACK.**",

## Video Content Analysis
When analyzing video content, it's often helpful to split the process into two steps: first retrieving relevant content, then generating insights. This approach allows for better control over the analysis process and more focused results.

```typescript copy

const { data: videoData } = await unbody.get
  .videoFile
  .search.about("programming tutorials")
  .select(
    "url",
    "autoSummary",
    "subtitles.entries.SubtitleEntry"
  )
  .exec();

// Step 2: Generate structured insights using Zod schema
const schema = z.object({
  title: z.string()
    .min(10, "Title must be descriptive")
    .describe("Title of the learning module"),
  keyPoints: z.array(
    z.object({
      timestamp: z.string()
        .regex(/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/, "Must be in MM:SS format"),
      topic: z.string(),
      summary: z.string()
        .min(30, "Summary must be detailed")
    })
  ).min(3, "Must include at least 3 key points"),
  codeSnippets: z.array(
    z.object({
      code: z.string(),
      explanation: z.string()
    })
  ).optional()
});
