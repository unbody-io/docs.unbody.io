## Getting Started

Using Unbody involves two main steps: **Configuration** and **Usage**. This page will walk you through the essentials so you can start building with Unbody right away.

Think of Unbody as a **new-age MERN or MEAN stack**—but reimagined for the AI era. From data ingestion to APIs, it provides everything you need to build modern, scalable AI-driven products without the complexity of piecing together multiple tools.

> Before diving into the steps, it's probably helpful to understand why Unbody exists, read [Why Unbody?](/why) to get a clear picture of the challenges it solves.

## How Unbody Works

At its core, Unbody transforms raw, unstructured & structured data into AI-ready knowledge and then enable you to develop products & features that powered by this knowledge.

Here’s how it works, step by step:
<Steps>
    ### Ingest Your Data
    Seamlessly integrate data from sources like [Google Drive](/providers/google-drive), [Discord](/providers/discord), [GitHub](/providers/github), or any custom source using the Push API (e.g., MongoDB). Alternatively, use Unbody as your primary, AI-ready database.
    <Cards>
        <Cards.Card title={"Backend Layer"}
                    href={"/backend-layer#how-it-works"}
                    arrow={true}>
            <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
                Learn more about the concepts.
            </small>
        </Cards.Card>
        <Cards.Card title={"Data Ingestion"}
                    href={"/data-ingestion/overview"}
                    arrow={true}>
            <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
                Learn more in technical detail.
            </small>
        </Cards.Card>
    </Cards>

    ### Process and Enrich
    Automatically clean, chunk, vectorize, and enhance your data to make it usable for AI models.
    <Cards>
        <Cards.Card title={"Backend Layer"}
                    href={"/backend-layer#how-it-works"}
                    arrow={true}>
            <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
                Learn more about the concepts.
            </small>
        </Cards.Card>
        <Cards.Card title={"Project Configuration"}
                    href={"/data-ingestion/overview"}
                    arrow={true}>
            <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
                Learn more in technical detail.
            </small>
        </Cards.Card>
    </Cards>

    ### Serve and Query
    Interact with your processed data through APIs, including a **GraphQL API** for semantic queries, an **Image API** for visual assets, and a **Video/Audio API** for multimedia.
    <Cards>
        <Cards.Card title={"API Layer"}
                    href={"/api-layer"}
                    arrow={true}>
            <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
                Learn more about the concepts.
            </small>
        </Cards.Card>
        <Cards.Card title={"GraphQL API"}
                    href={"/graphql-api/authorization"}
                    arrow={true}>
            <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
                Learn more in technical detail.
            </small>
        </Cards.Card>
    </Cards>
</Steps>

Unbody is built with **headless architecture**. This means:

- You can centralize your backend while staying agnostic to your frontend framework.
- Use a single backend to power multiple frontends—whether built with **Next.js**, **Nuxt.js**, or even custom setups with **Node.js** or **Express.js**.

This flexibility allows you to focus on building features, not wrestling with disparate stacks. Learn more about [Unbody’s architecture](/core-architecture-overview).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Unbody is a **commercial open-source framework**, but for now, the **cloud version** is the primary way to use it. Everything—from data ingestion to deployment—is hosted on our platform. The open-source release is on the way!
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
    You can use Unbody to:

    1. Build complete **AI-native products** from the ground up.
    2. Add **AI-native features** to existing applications with minimal effort.
</Callout>

## Your Next Steps

### 1. Configuration

Configuration is the first step to setting up your project. This is where you:

- Define your **data sources** (e.g., Google Drive, Discord, custom Push API).
- Choose your **AI models** and vectorizers.
- Configure **enhancers**, schemas, and generative modules.

There are two ways to set up Unbody:
<Cards>
    <Cards.Card title={"Setup with Dashboard"}
                href={"/get-started/step-1-setup/setup-with-dashboard"}
                arrow={true}>
        <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
            Setup Unbody using the Dashboard (easy way)
        </small>
    </Cards.Card>
    <Cards.Card title={"Setup with SDK"}
                href={"/get-started/step-1-setup/setup-with-sdk"}
                arrow={true}>
        <small className={"ml-4 opacity-75"}>
            Setup Unbody using the SDK (advance)
        </small>
    </Cards.Card>
</Cards>

### 2. Usage

Once your project is configured, start using Unbody to interact with your data. This includes:

- Querying data with **GraphQL**.
- Using specialized APIs for images, videos, and audio.
- Connecting your AI models for semantic search, RAG, or conversational interfaces.
