## Analyze Video Content
# Analyze Video Content
Analyze subtitle content from videos by extracting story elements and generating structured insights. Perfect for understanding narrative flow and key moments in video transcripts.

The example demonstrates advanced video analysis combining subtitle queries with structured content generation:
- Fetches video subtitles with size constraints and timing information
- Uses role-based messages to request story analysis
- Enforces structured output with Zod schema, capturing:
 - Story context (location, characters, timeframe)
 - Key moments and their significance
 - Humor elements (setup/punchline)
 - Overall narrative tone

Results are validated against the schema by [Zod](https://zod.dev/), ensuring consistent analysis format.

```typescript copy
    const {
      data: { payload: subtitleFiles },
    } = await unbody.get.subtitleFile
        .where(({ LessThan }) => ({
            media: {

                    size: LessThan(10000000),
                },

        )
        .exec();

    const { entries } = subtitleFiles[0];
