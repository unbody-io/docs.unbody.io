# **Frontend Layer**

The **Frontend Layer** provides the building blocks for integrating Unbody's AI-native capabilities into your applications. Designed primarily as a **React component library**, it enables developers to seamlessly incorporate features like:

- AI-enhanced media handling (e.g., face cropping, background replacement).
- Multimodal search and retrieval interfaces.
- Dynamic video and audio players with automatic metadata and chapters.

While still in its early stages, this layer reflects Unbody's philosophy of simplifying AI-native development by offering reusable, intuitive frontend tools.

**Whatâ€™s Next?** Future releases will expand this library, covering more frameworks and adding features based on developer feedback.
