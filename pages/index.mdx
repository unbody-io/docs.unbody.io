# Build the Future with Unbody

Apps today must **think, speak, and solve problems**, but traditional development stacks—built for static data and CRUD workflows—can’t support this shift. Whether you’re adding AI to existing products (AI-enabled) or building apps where AI is the DNA (AI-native), traditional stacks quickly fall apart.

Unbody is a unified development stack for the AI era. It replaces fragmented workflows with a single system. From **data ingestion** to **vectorization**, from **semantic APIs** to **deployment**, Unbody gives you everything you need in one place—no duct tape, no fragile workflows.

Think of Unbody as a modern replacement for **MERN** or **MEAN**, but rebuilt for AI.

Unbody can help you in two key ways:
- **Start AI-first**: Build AI-native products from scratch, like a smarter Wikipedia, or Preplexity for your own data.
- **Add AI features**: Integrate AI-driven capabilities into your existing apps, like chatbots, semantic search, or recommendation engines.

## What Unbody Offers
- **[Semantic Database](https://weaviate.io/)**: Vectorized storage for semantic search and dynamic relationships.
- **AI Pipeline**: Seamlessly ingest, clean, vectorize, and enrich data.
- **AI Integration**: Connect [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), or your custom models.
- **Intelligent GraphQL API**: Deliver generative responses, semantic search, and recommendations.
- **Media Tools**: On-the-fly image processing, video streaming, and a global CDN.
- **Function Calling (Coming Soon)**: Build systems that think, act, and solve problems autonomously.
