# Prebuilt Integrations

Prebuilt integrations—referred to as **data providers** in Unbody—make it easy to connect and ingest data from widely used platforms. These providers handle the complexities of data ingestion, letting you focus on building your application.

Unbody's prebuilt data providers are designed to work seamlessly, no extra configuration required.

### How It Works

1. **Connect a Data Provider**:
    
    Use the Unbody dashboard to link your account with a supported platform.
    
2. **Select Data Sources**:
    
    Specify the repositories, folders, or channels you want to ingest from.
    
3. **Automated Sync**:
    
    Unbody ingests and prepares the data for processing, enrichment, and vectorization.
