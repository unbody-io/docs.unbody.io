# Generative API Overview

The Generative API allows you to generate content independently of any attached data. It is versatile and supports various configurations for flexible use cases.

The API has the following methods available:
1. `.generate.text()`: Generates text based on prompts or message arrays.
2. `.generate.json()`: Generates structured JSON based on prompts, messages, or schemas.

Each method supports optional settings to control output style, length, and other properties.

- [JSON Generation](./json-gen.md)
