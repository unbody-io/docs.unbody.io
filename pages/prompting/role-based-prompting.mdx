# Role-based Prompting

Use message arrays to create rich, context-aware interactions with multiple roles. This method provides more control over the conversation flow compared to single prompts.

## Basic Role-based Generation
When you want type-safe, structured responses from your prompts, use [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema validation with role-based messages. The example shows product review analysis with strictly defined response types. 

```typescript copy
import { z } from "zod";

const {
    data: { payload },
} = await unbody.generate
                .json(
                    [
                        {
                            role: "system",
                            content: `You are a product analytics expert. Analyze product reviews to extract:
                            - Overall sentiment and score
                            - Key mentioned features and their reception
                            - Common pain points
                            - Suggested improvements
                            Ensure analysis is data-driven and actionable.`,
                        },
                        {
                            role: "user",
                            content: `Reviews to analyze:

                            3. "Perfect for daily use. Screen quality is amazing, though price is a bit high."`,
                        },
