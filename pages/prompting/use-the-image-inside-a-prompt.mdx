# Use the image inside a prompt

Generate content by providing images as input through messages. The system can analyze and describe images using advanced AI models.

## Basic Image Generation
When you need to analyze or generate from images, use message arrays with image inputs. 


```typescript copy
    const {
      data: { payload },
    } = await unbody.generate
          .text(
              [
                {
                  role: "system",
                  content: "Describe these images",
                },
                {
                  type: "image",
                  content: {
                    url: "https://www.treadfirst.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/riseBlog.jpg",
                    // Images about a Car
                  },
                },
              ],
              {
                model: "gpt-4-turbo",
                maxTokens: 500,
                temperature: 0.7,
              }
          );
    ```
