# Semantic Search

Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches, allowing users to find relevant content even when exact terms don't match.

## Basic Search
In this example, we demonstrate how to perform a semantic search. The code initiates a search query using the `.search.about()` method on the `textDocument` collection, selecting specific fields (`title`, `autoSummary`, `text`) to return.

<Tabs items={['Unbody SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    const {
      data: { payload },
    }  = await unbody.get.textDocument
        .search
        .about("AI applications")
        .select("title", "autoSummary", "text")
        .exec();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {
      Get {
        TextDocument(nearText: {
          concepts: ["AI applications"]
        }) {
          _additional {
            certainty
            distance
          }
          title
          autoSummary
          text
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Collapse title="Response">
```typescript
const response = {
  "_additional": {
    "certainty": 0.89,
    "distance": 0.21
  },
  "title": "AI in Healthcare",
  "autoSummary": "AI applications in healthcare..."
}
```
</Collapse>


## Search with Concept Boost
In this example, we demonstrate how to perform a semantic search with concept boosting. The code uses the `.search.about()` method on the textBlock collection, enhancing results towards specific concepts with a force factor, while selecting the text field and limiting to 5 results.

<Tabs items={['Unbody SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
      const {
         data: { payload },
      } = await unbody.get.textBlock.search
              .about("AI applications", {
                moveTo: {
                  concepts: ["Deep Learning", "LLM", "chatbot"],
                  force: 0.5,
                },
              })
              .select("text")
              .limit(5)
              .exec();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {
      Get {
        TextBlock(
          nearText: {concepts: ["AI applications"], moveTo: {concepts: ["Deep Learning", "LLM", "chatbot"], force: 0.5}}
          limit: 5
        ) {
          _additional {
            certainty
            distance
          }
          text
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Collapse title="Response">

## Advanced Search with Concept Steering
In this example, we demonstrate an advanced semantic search with concept steering. The code uses the `.search.about()` method on the `textDocument` collection with multiple concepts, using `moveTo` to enhance relevance towards modern AI concepts and `moveAwayFrom` to filter out legacy systems. The query includes sorting by `createdAt`, filtering by certainty, and limiting to 5 results.
