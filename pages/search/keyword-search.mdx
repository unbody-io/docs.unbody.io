# Keyword Search

Search based on exact keyword matches within your data, ideal for precise matching when users know specific terms they're looking for.

## Basic Search
When you need to find documents containing specific terms exactly as written, keyword search is your best option. For instance, searching for "machine learning" will return only documents that contain that exact phrase.

<Tabs items={['Unbody SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    const {
      data: { payload },
    } = await unbody.get.textDocument
        .search
        .find("machine learning")
        .select("originalName", "text", "autoSummary")
        .exec();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {
      Get {
        TextDocument(bm25: {
          query: "machine learning"
        }) {
          _additional {
            score
          }
          originalName
          text
          autoSummary
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Collapse title="Response">
```typescript
[
    {
        "_additional": {
            "score": "0.8542"
        },
        "autoSummary": "This comprehensive guide covers fundamental concepts of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The document explores practical applications in data analysis and predictive modeling.",
        "originalName": "machine-learning-fundamentals.pdf",
        "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience..."
    },
    {
        "_additional": {
            "score": "0.7621"
        },
        "autoSummary": "A practical introduction to machine learning algorithms and their implementation in Python. Includes code examples and best practices for model training and evaluation.",
        "originalName": "ml-algorithms-guide.pdf",
        "text": "Understanding machine learning algorithms requires knowledge of both statistics and programming..."
    }
]
```
</Collapse>

## Field-Specific Search
Sometimes you want to search for keywords only in certain parts of your documents - like titles or summaries - while ignoring the main content.

    ```typescript
    const {
      data: { payload },
    } = await unbody.get.textDocument
        .search
        .find("neural networks", ["title", "autoSummary"])
        .select("originalName", "properties", "autoSummary")
        .exec();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {

          bm25: {
            query: "neural networks",
            properties: ["title", "autoSummary"]
          }
        ) {
          _additional {
            score
          }
          originalName
          properties

        }
      }
    }
