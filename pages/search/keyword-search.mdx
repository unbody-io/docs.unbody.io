# Keyword Search

Search based on exact keyword matches within your data, ideal for precise matching when users know specific terms they're looking for.

## Basic Search
Performs a simple keyword search to find exact matches in all text fields.

<Tabs items={['Unbody SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    const data = await unbody.get.textDocument
        .search
        .find("machine learning")
        .select("originalName", "text", "autoSummary")
        .exec();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {
      Get {
        TextDocument(bm25: {
          query: "machine learning"
        }) {
          _additional {
            score
          }
          originalName
          text
          autoSummary
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

```typescript
[
    {
        "_additional": {
            "score": "0.8542"
        },
        "autoSummary": "This comprehensive guide covers fundamental concepts of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The document explores practical applications in data analysis and predictive modeling.",
        "originalName": "machine-learning-fundamentals.pdf",
        "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience..."
    },
    {
        "_additional": {
            "score": "0.7621"
        },
        "autoSummary": "A practical introduction to machine learning algorithms and their implementation in Python. Includes code examples and best practices for model training and evaluation.",
        "originalName": "ml-algorithms-guide.pdf",
        "text": "Understanding machine learning algorithms requires knowledge of both statistics and programming..."
    }
]
```

## Field-Specific Search
Search for keywords within specific fields of your documents.

<Tabs items={['Unbody SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    const data = await unbody.get.textDocument
        .search
        .find("neural networks", ["title", "autoSummary"])
        .select("originalName", "properties", "autoSummary")
        .exec();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {
      Get {
        TextDocument(
          bm25: {
            query: "neural networks",
            properties: ["title", "autoSummary"]
          }
        ) {
          _additional {
            score
          }
          originalName
          properties
          autoSummary
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

```typescript
