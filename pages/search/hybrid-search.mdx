# Hybrid Search

Combines both semantic and keyword search capabilities to provide comprehensive results that match both meaning and specific terms.

## Basic Search
When you need results that match both concepts and exact terms, [Hybrid Search](/content-api/search/hybrid-search) is your solution. For example, searching for "AI in healthcare" will find documents that are conceptually about healthcare AI and contain those specific keywords.

   const {
     data: { payload }
   } = await unbody.get
                   .textDocument
                   .search.hybrid("AI in healthcare", {
                     properties: ["text", "title"]
                   })
                   .select("title", "text", "autoSummary")
                   .exec();
   ```
 </Tabs.Tab>
 <Tabs.Tab>
   ```graphql
   {
     Get {
       TextDocument(hybrid: {
         query: "AI in healthcare",
         properties: ["text", "title"]
       }) {
         _additional {
           score
         }
         title
         text
         autoSummary
       }
     }
   }
   ```
 </Tabs.Tab>

## Advanced Search
Sometimes you need to fine-tune your search results by combining semantic vectors with specific keyword matching. Using [Advanced Hybrid Search](/content-api/search/hybrid-search#advanced-usage), you can prioritize certain fields like titles and tags while maintaining semantic relevance.
