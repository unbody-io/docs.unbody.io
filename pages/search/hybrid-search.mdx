# Hybrid Search

Combines both semantic and keyword search capabilities to provide comprehensive results that match both meaning and specific terms.

## Basic Search
Let's say you have a large collection of documents and need to find content that is both conceptually relevant and contains specific key terms. Hybrid search combines semantic understanding with keyword matching to deliver more comprehensive results than either method alone.

    ```typescript
    const {
      data: { payload },
    } = await unbody.get.textDocument
        .search
        .hybrid("AI in healthcare", {
            properties: ["text", "title"]
        })
        .select("title", "text", "autoSummary")
        .exec();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {
      Get {
        TextDocument(hybrid: {
          query: "AI in healthcare",
          properties: ["text", "title"]
        }) {
          _additional {
            score
          }
          title
          text
          autoSummary
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Collapse title="Response">

## Advanced Search
Sometimes you need more precise control over search results, especially when dealing with technical or specialized content. For instance, when searching for "Generative AI" documents, you might want to prioritize results that match specific semantic vectors (representing particular concepts or themes) while also ensuring they contain relevant keywords in their titles and tags. This approach is particularly useful for creating targeted content recommendations or building specialized knowledge bases.

    ```typescript
    const {
      data: { payload },
    } = await unbody.get.googleDoc
        .search
        .hybrid("Generative AI", {
            alpha: 0.7,
            vector: [0.0055148206, 0.013368472, 0.035909854],
            fusionType: "relativeScoreFusion",
            properties: ["title", "tags"]
        })
        .exec()
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```graphql
    {
      Get {
        TextDocument(
          hybrid: {
            query: "Generative AI",
            alpha: 0.7,
            vector: [0.0055148206, 0.013368472, 0.035909854],
            fusionType: relativeScoreFusion,
            properties: ["title", "tags"]
          }
        ) {
          _additional {
            score
          }
          title
          autoSummary
