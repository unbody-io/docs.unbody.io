# Architecture Overview

To understand Unbody’s architecture, it’s important to first understand its philosophy—and why it exists.

We created Unbody to address a fundamental problem: the fragmented nature of existing tools and frameworks. These tools were designed to add AI as a feature to existing products, not to build truly **AI-native products**. Our goal was to build a tool that could enable developers—especially those from product backgrounds—to create **AI-native products** effortlessly and without needing specialized AI expertise.

We define **AI-native** as products that don’t just use AI but are designed to **understand humans, respond intelligently, and adapt to user needs**. Achieving this required us to rethink software architecture entirely, centering it around two principles:

1. **Knowledge Flow**: Transforming raw data into actionable knowledge, not just managing static information.
2. **Modularity**: Making every step of the process adaptable and extensible, so developers can shape workflows to meet their needs.

With these principles in mind, Unbody’s architecture is organized into four layers: Backend, API, Frontend, and Utility. Together, they form a unified stack for building AI-native applications.
