# **Utility Layer**

The **Utility Layer** houses tools that are not strictly part of other layers but play a crucial role in enhancing the developer experience. These utilities often complement other modules and layers, bridging gaps and simplifying workflows.

So far, the Utility Layer includes the following:

- **Natural Language Query Parsing**: Converts unstructured user input, like *“Find all documents from last week”*, into structured queries for GraphQL or the database.
- **Ranking and Re-ranking**: Adjusts the order of results based on relevance, custom rules, or user behavior.

This layer is modular and flexible, ensuring you can integrate what you need without unnecessary overhead.
