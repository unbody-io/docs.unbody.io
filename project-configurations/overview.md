# Project Configuration Overview

## Understanding Configuration Lifecycle

When creating a new project, youâ€™ll configure essential settings that define how your project processes and handles data. These configurations include:

[Configure models for converting text and images into vectorsVectorizers](/project-configurations/vectorizers)[Set up enhancement pipelines for data processing and enrichmentEnhancers](/project-configurations/enhancers)[Configure AI models for content generationGenerative Modules](/project-configurations/generative-modules)[Define and extend data structures for your projectCustom Schemas](/project-configurations/custom-schemas)

Most of these settings become permanent after project creation to ensure consistency and stability in your data processing pipeline.

## Immutable vs Configurable Settings

Once a project is created, most configuration settings are **immutable** and cannot be changed. The only configurable setting after project creation is the **Generator Module Models**.
