# Connect Images

1.  Click `Add New Source` in your project
2.  Select `Google Drive` from sources
3.  Connect your Google account
4.  Select folders with images to index
5.  Click `Initialize` to start processing

This will take some time. You can monitor indexing in the [dashboard](https://app.unbody.io) under `project` / `source` / `logs`.
