# 2\. Connect Google Docs

1.  Click `Add New Source` in your project dashboard
2.  Select `Google Drive` from data sources
3.  Connect your Google account through OAuth
4.  Select the folder containing your Google Docs (Not the Drive)
5.  Click `Initialize` to start indexing

This will take some time. You can monitor indexing in the [dashboard](https://app.unbody.io) under `project` / `source` / `logs`.
